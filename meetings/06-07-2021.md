# Notes

* Cadence - monthly
* chat - invite-only slack channel on the filecoin slack
 
Discussion - go-ipfs

Brooke: 
- running go-ipfs nodes on AWS with the s3 plugin
- websockets from the browser
- single s3 store
- no pin lists or garbage collection
- will pull in from the nodes until one finishes
- used to run ipfs-cluster, failed badly one day, hacked something together afterwards

james:
 - who is running the s3 plugin?

Boris:
 - we will share OSS tooling and infra diagrams

Val
 - sounds familiar
 - recently published terraform module
 - using s3

JW: do you share blocks?

Val: so far not. Mostly connectivity issues. Running behind a load balancer, heavily rely on pub/sub, seeing connectivity issues

Boris:
 - compiling s3 plugin is work

Val:
 - running js-ipfs, no compile step, deps management

Ignacio:

 - considered running shared block stores or remote ones. Unsure about how pinning plays with shared blockstore - is safe?

 - new project - running IPFS-cluster
 - been discussing with hector, tested with leveldb, solved garbage collection issues
 - doesn't seem to be safe to add data and run GC concurrently
 - might lose data prior to pinning
 - correct operations to solve these problems?
 - doesn't want to solve in the application layer, feels like re-inventing the wheel.


Matt:

- we ended up implementing ipfs-cluster work around to solve GC issues
- don't use the s3 repo - how is that working?
- experimenting with it, want to make sure it can solve their issues
- one block store / multiple nodes? would liek to discuss more.

Boris:

 - talked to Amazon about native s3 support, bt support had been recently turned off

Matt: anyone running s3 outside of AWS?

Gregory: We configured s3 plugin outside of AWS, using CORTX open source. See https://github.com/Seagate/cortx/blob/main/doc/integrations/ipfs.md

Gregory: anyone on-prem?

JW: Raspberry PI

Michael Burns: Baremetal in the cloud.

Boris: working on cli work to run own nodes

Brooke: 

- using autoscaling? 
- running their own bootstrap nodes?
- getting cloud native scaling
- would like something like ***booster - single block, multiple nodes. 
- nothing currently


Boris: go-ipfs is not meant to be run in data centers

Michael:

 - logging, configuration, suited for a prototype but not built for eg k8s
 - glaring: config file has both sensitive data and generic data.
 - can't do env vs cli vs config


Thibault

 - not using ipfs client, using it as a library
 - not using s3, using custom datastore
 - lots of features added - peering to keep connection with the nodes
 - trying to reduce custom config.

 - lots of work to modify how config happens
 - needs to update public github repo
 - custom go project, import go-ipfs library
 - just serving, no storage
 - custom GC



Val

 - connectivity between nodes
 - swarm connecting every hour
 - pub-sub messages every minute


Discordian

 - chat demo - has to send keepalive messages to keep connections alive


Brooke

 - cloud nodes reconnect every hour
 - before requests, full connect


Matt:
 - have you looked at the peering config?
 - have both running, overkill


Val:
 - DHT off, swarm connections are still not staying alive
 - don't understand gossip well enough to understand connection drops.


JW: 
 - matt are you using private networks


Matt: no, we could do it, nobody has asked that

JW: want our stuff to be online, looing at a hybrid
 - private stuff for our customers
 - also other unrelated nods that can broadcast


Matt: "dedicated networks" - shared key. "sharding?"

JW: static file hosting over http

Matt: remembers a project that does public / private

Our Trade? "RTrade"! - probably closed source

Boris: 

 - DMCA?

Thibault - custom code to do DMCA

Michael: nginx and lua script
 - open resty - distribution - lua automate all the things
 - open code on how to do this
 - for every request:
   - find CID
     - check against deny list

Deny list: json that has CIDs etc that is hashed. List isn't served in plain text

 - now automated mostly!

Boris: has domain badhashlist.com let's think about how to use that.

Volunteers:
Michael, Sid

Next regular meeting: 

* Michael's fierce DMCA nginx demo!!
