## Discussion

DMCA requests

Boris: 

* we got takedown requests related to content available via our open gateway
* PL has an nginx proxy that is automated to block specific content
* Cloudflare has some code integrated in their solution to solve this
* blocking: 'gateway no fetch'

Jeff:

* wish we would make more use of the IPFS OPS github org to share implementations of things over time

Asmir:

* code is mostly shareable
* only using one node


Boris:

* "we're pretty vanilla" - share high level architecture diagrams is easier and useful at this point

Brendan

* not an issue so far
* things are available, don't fetch anything outside the system
* system won't accept anything that isn't a qri dataset
* has to be signed
* "pretty locked down"
* network topology / network management ?

Jeff

* we can talk about how fission works.
* james?

James

* sure
* AWS
* using nixos bare AMIs
* 2 regions - EU and US-east-1
* no containers
* using s3 for central storage
* costs are starting to mount wrt s3
* may just temporarily go to local storage on the nodes
* s3 shared block setup  - charge per access - nodes are fetching tons of small blocks, costs per request

* s3 buckets are split within the region
* we ensure nodes are connected across availability zones
* we tried ipfs-cluster, didn't work well
* use a rest service to ensure pins are in place

Boris:

* cluster - hector spoke on this
* most people evaluated a while ago
* a bunch of open question on how to use and outside use cases
* found out recently turning out pinning in js-ipfs makes it way faster

Brendan:

* pinning and block store are notoriously difficult to manage
* slowness: GC after unpinning a few blocks
* block stpore interface doesn't have a querying interface
* have to walk the block store!!
* in js-ipfs - don't know the status of bitswap
* if you ipfs add, you hit similar problems
* turning off pinning will remove local and network perf problems
* bitswap is really tough
* lots of recent improvements

Jeff: what are the downsides of turning off these things?

Brendan: storage, creating zombie blocks

Boris: and we don't care because it's local

Brendan: and that makese sense, the client node is not the root source of data

Boris: 

* js-ipfs should just work, connect to other nodes, not useful for much beyond demos
* are you running go-ipfs in your desktop client

Brendan:

* yes, go-ipfs, lots
* main use case is avoiding centralized storage, data needs to be distributed
* long term goal is to get people to use qri desktop, make more data available
* can provide datasets directly from desktop or other nodes in a distributed way

Boris:

* hard to get people to keep something they care about
* thinking of starting very simple "I care about x" list that pin adds specific things on a schedule
* not just fission but also greater IPFS ecosystem
* cloudflare: great solution for linking these things, more and more people are using IPNS
* also: DIDs in DNS

Brendan 

* we have done some memory testing on macOS, have seen gc-related memory problems

James: 

* we use NixOS, it's great

Asmir:

* k8s
* manaing pins correctly is tricky
* IPFS node is just one big node
* avoiding clustering, didn't have the time, we should get back to it
* issues:
** maintaining the egresses, load balancers
** when we introduced websockets, it got harder to do sticky sessions
** save a lot of issues with one or few nodes
** will run into bottlenecks soon
** would be nice to expose IPFS more directly
** downloads now go directly to the source, used to double-load for reasons

Brendan

* k8s is an evail we've accepted into our hearts
* have a real time-bomb on our hands?
* as it stands now - max out and get good at persistent volme claims
* don't use badger, vanilla config
* nice thing: unaware of restarts, k8s 
* decoupled data availability from netowrk connectors - latter falls over all the time, IPFS box with the data is separate
* do most data shuttline is http
* on GCP - goog keeps complaining that they are crypto-mining!


James:

* have you turned down the number of peers you keep - 

Brendan:
* No - 400? 450?
* qri manages this as well.
